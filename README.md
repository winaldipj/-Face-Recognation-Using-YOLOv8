# -Face-Recognation-Using-YOLOv8

The face recognition project uses YOLO v8 technology with custom model, 
which is one of the advanced technologies of computer vision in object detection with facial recognition models. 
The dataset used is a primary dataset obtained from several student photos and images taken from a webcam, 
then processed with image labeling to customize the data so that it can produce a custom model with an accuracy level of more than 99 percent.
This project is capable of running object detection-based facial recognition applications, 
and features a combination of deep learning and computer vision for facial recognition technology.

# Project Details

- YOLOv8 was used for object detection.
- The images were resized to 640x640 pixels.
- The pretrained-model used is YOLOv8n.
